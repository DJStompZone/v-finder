# V-FINDER
## V-finder is a script mainly coded in python and a bit of bash using nmap  
### PLEASE FOLLOW THE STEPS FOR SETUP BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK ON SOME DISTROS
This program will enable you to find vulnerabilities in any system  
You can use any of the nmap options.This proram is only available for Linux (Ubuntu,Debian,Fedora and Manjaro)   
I decided to make this scanner because I wanted people to have an easy to use and simple scanner only requiring the user to input the ip and options and to make less complicated to install,setup and for scanning this tool will become better,it is already simpler than nmap,all you have to do is execute the script and enter the IP and options when asked \
I thank nmap for making this amazing tool and people on discord who helped me with the code especially  who gave me a solution to code when he was not allowed.I hope you enjoy this tool and you are welcome to give me some feedback about it !!!\
DISCLAIMER : THIS TOOL IS NOT FOR FINDING VULNERABILITIES IN A SYSTEM AND THEN USING THESE VULNERAILITIES TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION,THIS IS ILLEGAL,ONLY HACK DEVICES WHICH YOU OWN OR HAVE PERMISSION TO HACK,I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF YOU GET ARRESTED\
Steps for setup   
``git clone https://github.com/solitary8/v-finder``\
`` python -m venv vfinder`` it's to make a venv because on some distros like raspberry pi OS there's isn't the customtkinter library\
`` source ./vfinder/bin/activate`` It's to login into your venv (virtual environment) if you ever want to log out run ``deactivate``\
``cd v-finder``\
``chmod +x setup.sh``\
``./setup.sh`` or ``bash setup.sh``\
Run ``python3 v-finder3.0.py`` once you're logged in your venv\
Have fun and have a nice day :)!!!
