# v-finder
## V-finder is a script coded in bash using nmap   
This program will enable you to find vulnerabilities in any system  
You can use any of the nmap options.This proram is only available for Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) and macOSX(In testing)  
I decided to make this scanner because I wanted people to have a more automated scanner and to make less complicated to install,setup and for scanning this tool will become better I will add additional scripts to install that will be very simple to install (only needing to execute an install script),
I thank nmap for making this amazing tool and people on discord who helped me with the code especially  who gave me a solution to code when he was not allowed.I hope you enjoy this tool and you are welcome to give me some feedback about it !!!\
DISCLAIMER : THIS TOOL IS NOT FOR FINDING VULNERABILITIES IN A SYSTEM THAT IS NOT YOURS,THIS IS ILLEGAL,ONLY HACK DEVICES WHICH YOU OWN OR HAVE PERMISSION TO HACK,I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF YOU GET ARRESTED\
