# port-scanner
This is a port scanner coded in bash using nmap I will upgrade it to integrate more and more of the nmap options,this scanner is for Linux and macOS 
I decided to make this scanner because I wanted people to have a more automated scanner and to make less complicated to install,setup and for scanning this tool will become better I will add additional scripts to install that will be very simple to install (only needing to execute an install script),
I thank nmap for making this amazing tool and people on discord who helped me with the code especially @St3ve who gave me a solution to code when he was not allowed.I hope you enjoy this tool and you are welcome to give me some feedback about it !!!
DISCLAIMER : THIS TOOL IS NOT FOR FINDING VULNERABILITIES IN A SYSTEM THAT IS NOT YOURS,THIS IS ILLEGAL,ONLY HACK DEVICES WHICH YOU OWN OR HAVE PERMISSION TO HACK,I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF YOU GET ARRESTED
